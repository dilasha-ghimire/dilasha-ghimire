# Hi there, I'm Dilasha GhimireðŸ‘‹

I'm a curious and driven Computer Science student with a growing passion for data science and its power to solve real-world problems. From coding projects to uncovering insights through data, I enjoy exploring how technology can make life smarter, simpler, and more impactful.

As a girl in tech, I'm always eager to learn, build, and collaborate. I love diving into new tools, experimenting with ideas, and constantly challenging myself to improve.
